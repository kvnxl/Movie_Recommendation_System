# Movie_Recommendation_System
Recommendation systems are computer programs that suggest recommendations to users depending on a variety of criteria.  These systems estimate the most likely product that consumers will buy and that they will be interested in. Netflix, Amazon, and other companies use recommender systems to help their users find the right product or movie for them. This project is for recommending movies.
